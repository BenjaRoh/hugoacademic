I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Sociology at the University of Mannheim. As a political and historical sociologist, I use quantitative and computational methods to study elite political action.

My dissertation examines the relationship between state formation and the emergence of the first political parties in the state of New York between 1777 and 1820. It pays particular attention to the processes that tied political elites into the emerging party system, focusing on the role of social networks and political careers. This research was supported by an NSF Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant. 

Other work analyzes the career paths that led into elite administrative positions in the American state between 1850 and 2000, the structure of political careers in China from 1978 to 2012, and the structure of political discourse in Renaissance Florence. You can read more about my work [here]({{< ref "#research" >}}).
